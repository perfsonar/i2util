#I2 Utility library. 

Currently contains:
* error logging
* command-line parsing
* threading

The error logging and command-line parsing are taken from a utility library
that is distributed with the "volsh" code from UCAR.

I have used this in the past - and it seemed silly not to use it since it
is freely distributed.
